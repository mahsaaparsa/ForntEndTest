# Interface Development Test

### Test instructions
Attached you will find two screenshots representing two content blocks in a page. Complete the following:
* Build a HTML page containing two sections that will look like the colors.PNG and shapes.PNG.
* Use modern [HTML5 standards](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp).
* Build a container area that will make sure these sections will always sit in the center of the page (Inspiration/Tip: [bootstrap's](https://getbootstrap.com/) `.container` class)
* Use JavaScript to capture all anchor clicks, and `console.log()` the element which has been clicked.
* All content areas should be deemed as being populated from a CMS - so all copy lengths can vary!
(Inspiration/Tip: [CSS flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp), or alternativ solutions from HTML4) 
* Bonus: Any CSS3 animation

### Technologies
* Any CSS-preprocessors (LESS preferred).
* Any CSS frameworks (Bootsrap preferred).
* If vanilla CSS is used, please include some reasoning for the decision.
* Build tools and task runners are encouraged (i.e. grunt/gulp/webpack).

### Layout
* The layout is expected to work in the **latest Chrome/FireFox/Edge versions and IE11**.
* The layout should be **responsive** and work on a `320px` mobile device.
* Bearing in mind that this application is expected to be responsive, the developer should consider the appropriate **`<meta>` tags**.
* *shapes.png:* Each image in this section should **display in a modal on click**.
* *colours.png:* These items should be **links to new pages**.

### Review Criteria
We are looking for your ability to give life to static designs. During that process consider:
* *Project structure:* Clean project and logical traversal.
* *JavaScript:* Efficiency of code and efficacy in bringing the design to life.
* *Interface:* Semantic markup and styling.
* *Git:* Bonus points for submission on a github account that shows multiple commits.
* *CSS3 animation*: Bonus points on showing CSS 3 animations.
* *Quality:* Production-grade.
